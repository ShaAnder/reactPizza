## Summary

This summary section is pretty much a small snippet to what i had learnt so far with react.

This app was first and foremost very fun to build, it showcased how one could utilize the various features of react and component building to create a real world ordering application and as well as this it has potential to be upscaled to a full app in the future

Below we can see a list of summarized learning points and feel free to ask or dm me about them so i can go more into depth:

- Code refactoring
- setting up react apps
- Components and optimization
- prop utilization and destruction
- conditional rendering

and more

## TO DO

This project while small in scale now has the very real potential to become a large scale app with time and knowledge gained and i look forward to working on it
